    The Server Works! <br>
    You wouldn't believe how happy I am with this! <br>
    I'm probably just going to write some entertaining stuff from here. <br>
    <br>
    I'd say my favorite kind of pasta would be Fettucini Carbonara, <br>
    but like the authentic stuff. It's SOOOO GOOOD when it's done right, don't get it at Olive Garden tho. <br>
    <br>
    This reminds me so much of when I was learning HTML back in highschool. <br>
    Speaking of, I may go back and re-work that old website I made. <br>
    It was like a little site about myself and other miscellaneous things, <br>
    so I bet it'd be nice to go and look back at, like a time capsule of sorts. <br>
    <br>
    
    <br>
    Anyway, that's about all I got. Here's an internet joke: <br>
    <br>
    Never gonna give you up, <br>
    Never gonna let you down, <br>
    Never gonna go around   <br>
    And hurt you.   <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Thanks for reading this, hope you have a good day!
