    The Server Works! <br>
    The Index here is a test file, in the future I'll allow users to apply their own sites! <br>
    <br>
    Anyway, I feel like talking about pasta. <br>
    I'd say my favorite kind of pasta would be Fettucini Carbonara, <br>
    but like the authentic stuff. It's SOOOO GOOOD when it's done right, Olive Garden can't beat the authentic stuff. <br>
    <br>
    From where I've started here, I bet I could use this server for personal site templates.<br>
    But I honestly have no idea where or how I would utilize them outside of localhost without paying for a domain :( <br>
    If anyone reading this has advice about that, feel free to contact me, any and all help is appreciated!<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Anyway, that's about all I got. Here's an internet joke: <br>
    <br>
    Never gonna give you up, <br>
    Never gonna let you down, <br>
    Never gonna go around   <br>
    And hurt you.   <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Thanks for reading this, hope you have a good day!
